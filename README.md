# command-line-search

I used 3 external libraries:
* JUnit
* Apache IOUtils
* JSONObjects

Once these are installed, running should be as simple as running the main function.

##Shortcomings
* Only searches for the first occurrence of a given search term.
* Searching by organizations does not show tickets or users for the given organizations.
